This project is a python bot that assists with the popular Steam game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.
Game: https://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/Keep_Talking_and_Nobody_Explodes/
Manual: http://www.bombmanual.com/manual/1/pdf/Bomb-Defusal-Manual_1.pdf

The game normally requires a player operating the bomb, and a player reading the instruction manual.
This python bot should (eventually) be able to completely replace the manual player by being a click-through assistant
for the bomb player.

How to use:
Current version: run the .py file of the corresponding module on the Bomb using python 3.6
